### Game Programming

This repository is to keep track of my study of C++ specifically for game programming.
There is a logbook down below that you could go to, to see what progress I have made per study day.

### Source
I do this study with the help of this [book](https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Michael-Dawson/dp/1305109910) as intake for [BUas](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies)!

### Game Programming Logbook

  Started with study, introducion is about variables and ISO standard.

  Just learned the following:
  + short, recude the total number of values a variable can hold
  + long, increase the total number of values a variable can hold. Long is also able to modify doubles
  + unsigned, can only store integer of positive value
  + signed, can hold both negative and positive values of an integer, DEFAULT
  + typedef, is often used to create shorter names for types with long names. 
    E.x; typedef unsigned short int ushort;
         ushort score = 10;
  
  Created a small user based adventure program, and finished up some exercises of Chapter 1.
  I feel like I made a lot of progress due to this!

    Started with Chapter 2, it was about if statements and do-while loops. 
    Next up are the exercises as I finished up the theory.
    Finished up the exercises, I made sure to make it a [release](https://github.com/NiekMSoftware/GameProgramming/releases/tag/v1.0.1) as well! There were currently no bugs found, as it is a basic program.

    Started and finished chapter 3, it was about the usages of arrays and strings. How to check it's length and replace certain items from the arrays.
    Final project of the chapter was to create a [Word Jumble](https://github.com/NiekMSoftware/GameProgramming/releases/tag/v1.0.0-wordjumble) project. I have finished it also with release now.
