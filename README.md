### Game Programming

This repository is to keep track of my study of C++ specifically for game programming.
There is a logbook down below that you could go to, to see what progress I have made per study day.

### Source
I do this study with the help of this [book](https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Michael-Dawson/dp/1305109910) as intake for [BUas](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies)!

### Game Programming Logbook

#### 12/11/2023:
Started with study, introducion is about variables and ISO standard.

Just learned the following:
+ short, recude the total number of values a variable can hold
+ long, increase the total number of values a variable can hold. Long is also able to modify doubles
+ unsigned, can only store integer of positive value
+ signed, can hold both negative and positive values of an integer, DEFAULT
+ typedef, is often used to create shorter names for types with long names. 
  E.x; typedef unsigned short int ushort;
       ushort score = 10;

Created a small user based adventure program, and finished up some exercises of Chapter 1.
I feel like I made a lot of progress due to this!
