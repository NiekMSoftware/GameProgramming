### Game Programming

This repository is to keep track of my study of C++ specifically for game programming.
There is an [logbook](https://github.com/NiekMSoftware/GameProgramming/blob/main/logbook.txt) that you could go to, to see what progress I have made per study day.

### Source
I do this study with the help of this [book](https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Michael-Dawson/dp/1305109910) as intake for [BUas](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies)!
